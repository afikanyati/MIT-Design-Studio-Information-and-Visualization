This includes the city of Boston. Damaging impacts are likely for those communities exposed to the open ocean. * TIDAL DEPARTURE...Storm surge approaching 3 feet for today`s late morning high tide, near 4 feet for tonight`s high tide, and 3 to 3.5 feet for the Saturday midday high tide. * TIMING...Moderate to major impacts for three high tide cycles from late this morning to early Saturday afternoon. Minor to moderate impacts are expected for the Saturday night high tide. * COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Up to major coastal flooding in much of the warning area with severe damage to vulnerable shoreline structures likely. Some vulnerable homes along the immediate shoreline may be destroyed from the combination of high water and severe wave action. There will be widespread inundation of coastal roads and basements with life-threatening inundation depths above 3 feet in some locations, especially where wave overwash is involved. Many neighborhoods may be at risk of being cut off for an extended time. Flood waters will be extremely slow to recede after the late morning high tide. This is a very dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods will likely be necessary. * SHORELINE IMPACTS...Very severe to extreme erosion will occur and may compromise protective dunes, seawalls, and other structures. && Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour. Category thresholds are based on still water levels. Impacts may be greater, depending upon wave action.
